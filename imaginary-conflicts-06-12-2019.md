# Imaginary Conflicts

People are callous.
They become victims to self fulfiling profecies.
A person that percieves themselves as negative, becomes negative.
A person that percieves themselves as tired, becomes lathargic.
A person that believes that others dislike them, actually causes people to dislike them.
How? The person displays caution to compliments and conversations,
she judges other peoples behaviour towards themselves and it reflects as negativity and unfriendliness to others.
In time, others start limiting interactions with the person,
eventually exhibiting negativity towards the person - that is now deemed unsociable.


So what about conflicts? I propose most are imaginary; 
results of miscommunication, misinformation, and the hardened personality and views built from selfulfiling reinforcements.

On many such conflicts a pattern emerges: On one end, a person-A thinks that they are ignored, they reciprocate by ignoring person-B.
Person-B, not even knowing that they were not giving enough attention to the other now suddenly gets met with a wall when trying to reach out to person-A.
Person-A thinks that since Person-B had no time for them in prior days, they need not give them attention now; they treat the action as un authentic.
Person-B now starts thinking the same and overtime although each try to reach out to the other, their actions are seen as un authentic in the other's eyes and the initial feelings of being ignored become strengthend and eventually toxic.

You might be in an imaginary conflict yourself. It may not be with another person, it might even be with what you think about yourself.
Be maliable, open your mind, spend 10 minutes thinking about the positives before spending 1 minute thinking about the negatives.
