# Habits

> Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve; an analyst process ot refine.

The ideas I discussed are mostly derived from my personal experience and two written gems on the subject:
- [Atomic Habits](https://amzn.to/36CLUeS)
- [7 habits of highly effective people](https://amzn.to/2smlRK9)


What do to: 
- **Get 1% better every day**, and by the end of the year you will be 37x better. A 1% error by putting off your work for another day, compounds; and by the end of the year you will be 37x worse.

- **Plateau of latent potential** - Your success lags behind your habits; the progress takes a long time to be visible. Your potential builds up and starts to accumulate. Once you accumulate enough, your progress suddenly breaks through and becomes explodingly visible - you become an overnight success. Most people don't break the plateau, they get discouraged because of no visible progress and give up.
- **Goals don't work, systems work**
  - Every olympian wants to win the gold medal, every entrepeneur wants to be successful, everyone wants to meet their fitness goals.
  - Cleaning your room achieves your goal of a clean room, yet without a system your room will be quickly messy again; needing you to invest time, energy, and motivation yet again to clean your room.
  - Reaching your goals of getting a promotion, or working out rigurously for a week make you momentarily happy for achieving your goal. Alternatively, if you fail on your goals you become momentarily sad. You need motivation and energy to achieve your goals, and yet the hapiness aquired through achieving your goals may not be motivating enough to continue; forcing you to drive even more energy into achieving your next goal. Fall in love with the process of improving yourself and learning new skills, and you will be rewarded with career growth. Fall in love with the feeling you get when you are lifting weights and running, and you won't need any fitness goals.
