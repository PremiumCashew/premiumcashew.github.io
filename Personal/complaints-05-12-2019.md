# Complaints

I find myself complaining a lot; blaming the world for problems non existent.
Creating unnecessary complications in my mind and stressing myself out.
What I really need is sleep, and evaluation.
I need a schedule, something to abide by. But, to adhere to making a schedule and following it requires effort; 
that which I know I have, yet have failed to will it into existence many times.


I have many things I want to improve upon. The time I spend on my side projects being the first,
my physical health being second, and my career being third.
But to accomplish these goals requires sanity, that which I cannot achieve without proper rest and a balanced mind free of complaints.


I commit to you that tomorrow I will wake up fresh and begin my day early.
I ensure you that once I achieve my daily ritual of hydration, sanitation and consumption;
I will commit to finishing things I should have done some time ago.
And this will be my motivation to continue my productivity into other tasks that need completion.

And, to that I bid you goodnight.
