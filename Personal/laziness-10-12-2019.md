# Laziness

We are all lazy for many reasons. More recently, I find myself lazy for one particular reason:
there is too much for me to do! Enough that I find myself overwhelmed and stressed.
To combat this, I take unnecessary long breaks watching YouTube videos and playing video games.
I find my self going to bed late because I have made an excuse in my mind that I will stay up longer to get some
work done, instead, I spend most of my time in a wasteful manner. As a result, I find myself starting my day later.
Now even more stressed then the day prior, and begin to combat my anxiousness all the same; more video games and YouTube.
The cycle continues and affects my health, my sleep, and my sanity.

I am not helpless, and I have mostly just brought my mental state on myself.
I like that I am self reflecting and formulating what steps I need to do to get my self out of this situation.

Today, I will go to sleep on time. But before, I will make a TODO list of things to do tommorrow.
I know it will be motivating to cross items off the list; a simple nightly task, yet one that has done wonders for many.
