# Tired

I am tired, why?
Help.... so much work.
Why do I care about work so much?
How do I get motivation, how do I figure out what to prioritize?
What is important in life? ...I am not sure.
These questions and phrases haunt my mind as I sit here writing this excerpt.
I want to do something impactful with my life, but will I get it doing my current job?
The job pays well though, I am comfortable, at least monetarily. ...Is that good enough?
Is it good enough if I am tired all the damn time? My phone is dying and I need to charge it... till next time.
